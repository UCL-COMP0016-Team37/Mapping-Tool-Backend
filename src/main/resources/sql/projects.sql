Through this fully integrated development strategy, community members establish and manage their own programs to address food security, nutrition, health, education, microfinance, water and sanitation. Epicenters follow four distinct phases over a period of about five to eight years on a path toward to sustainable self-reliance.   Sonon-Guinagourou Epicenter is currently in Phase 4, during which villagers enter their transition to self-reliance and The Hunger Project begins to withdraw financial support. The epicenter community affirms its partnerships, ensures funding streams from revenue-generating activities and begins relying on its leadership structures for future growth. Trainings are led by community-based animators, and epicenter committees manage each program, including budget oversight and leadership transitions. The epicenter strengthens its partnerships, including solidifying and creating an even more powerful partnership with local government. Sonon-Guinagourou epicenter serves 9 villages with a total population of 19797 women, men and children in the Pèrèrè commune of <a href="http://www.thp.org/benin/">Benin</a>. ',' The Hunger Project promotes a holistic approach to food security, and many of its activities contribute to increased access to sufficient food but also improved diets, greater nutritional variety and stronger ties to local resources. For example, epicenter preschools provide hot, nutritious meals to students and epicenter rural banks offer loans and savings products that often increase the amount and quality of food at the household level. Most importantly, THP trains animators, who, with support from existing local and government institutions (farmers’ cooperatives, agricultural extension workers) hold trainings in farming technologies (row planting, field rotation), seed and soil types, and low-input yield-improving techniques (organic compost, microdose fertilizer application). The trainings take place at the epicenter demonstration farm, where crops are grown for consumption by the community and distribution to local school meal programs. ',' Additionally, THP implements an Agriculture Revolving Loan Fund. Through this fund, participating local farmers access seed and fertilizer loans at the start of the planting season. These loans are repaid post-harvest through in-kind reimbursement of bags of grain. This grain can then be sold at a fair price to the community over the lean season, not only improving food security but also re-capitalizing the loan fund for future lending. Lastly, THP works with each community to construct a secure and treated community food bank, which can store the harvest from the demonstration farm, reimbursements from the Agriculture Revolving Loan Fund, and even individual harvests for safe-keeping. The food bank is managed by a local Food Security Committee, which oversees the operations of the entire program; each committee is made up of equal numbers of men and women and is democratically elected by the epicenter populations.

This grain can then be sold at a fair price to the community over the lean season, not only improving food security but also re-capitalizing the loan fund for future lending.

The SDG Union Strategy is a demand-driven social development process in which communities move through phases of development at their own pace, self-directing and engaging in community priorities of their own choosing. The work proceeds through four phases: (i) Mobilization, (ii) Capacity Building, (iii) Taking action, and (iv) Assessing results. An SDG Union is a cluster of nine Bangladeshi villages that through partnership with THP has committed to achieving the SDGs at the local level. The SDGs will be achieved through increased engagement of active and informed citizens, enhanced democratic processes, and improved access to resources. The SDG Union Strategy looks to build volunteer-driven civil society from the bottom up, creating a shared vision for the union towards sustainable self-reliance and progress for all, driven by community mass-action.    The Maulvibazar Sadar Upazila is located in the Maulvibazar district, inside the Sylhet division of northeastern Bangladesh. THP works in two unions in Maulvibazar Sadar: Amtail and Nazirabad, and in 92 communities.',' The Hunger Project aims to strengthen Unions for transparent, accountable and inclusive governance at the local level in order to accelerate the achievement of the SDGs. Activities foster a partnership between the people, their elected local government representatives and, wherever possible, the government functionaries at the grassroots in order to help achieve the SDGs. The centerpiece of The Hunger Project''s strategy is the local level training and ongoing support of nearly 270,000 volunteer Animators, 60 percent of whom are women, who organize mass action campaigns in their areas. As mentioned above, the animators focus their actions in clusters of villages known as unions and work closely with the elected local government bodies, holding trainings focused on gender issues and leadership to local women leaders. These leaders then proceed to organize local meetings, lead workshops and initiate campaigns against early marriage and dowry, malnutrition, maternal and child mortality, gender discrimination, and inequality, illiteracy and corruption. ',' The Hunger Project has been active in Bangladesh since 1990 and is currently active in 29 districts, reaching 4.5 million people. The Hunger Project’s strategies in Bangladesh occur on two scales: one focuses on the local landscape at the union level (as described above), the other on the national, with significant strategic overlap. At the national level, The Hunger Project addresses two pernicious cultural conditions that form major barriers to ending hunger in Bangladesh: youth development, gender discrimination and corruption. This is done through Youth Ending Hunger (YEH), the National Girl Child Advocacy Forum (NGCAF) and Shujan (Citizens for Good Governance). Thousands of students participate in the YEH program, which mobilizes students across the country to conduct national campaigns based on such issues as nutrition, education, family planning, tree planting and environmental education. The Hunger Project catalyzed the creation of the national alliance NGCAF, committed to ending all forms of discrimination against girls. Each year on September 30, this alliance organizes National Girl Child Day events across the country. A formal alliance of 300 organizations, the NGCAF also works to address domestic violence and the spread of HIV/AIDS. Shujan is a country-wide platform of committed, active and socially conscious citizens, mobilized by The Hunger Project, to strengthen grassroots democracy, ensure transparency and accountability of local government, and carry out advocacy initiatives at the national level. Shujan is also working for political and election reform.

The SDG Union Strategy is a demand-driven social development process in which communities move through phases of development at their own pace, self-directing and engaging in community priorities of their own choosing. The work proceeds through four phases: (i) Mobilization, (ii) Capacity Building, (iii) Taking action, and (iv) Assessing results. An SDG Union is a cluster of nine Bangladeshi villages that through partnership with THP has committed to achieving the SDGs at the local level. The SDGs will be achieved through increased engagement of active and informed citizens, enhanced democratic processes, and improved access to resources.The SDG Union Strategy looks to build volunteer-driven civil society from the bottom up, creating a shared vision for the union towards sustainable self-reliance and progress for all, driven by community mass-action.    The Chakoria Upazila is located in the Cox''s Bazar districit, inside the Chittagong division of Bangladesh. THP works in two unions in Chakoria: Konakhali and Demusia, and in 20 communities. In 2016, there were 7 Women Leader Trainings and 150 women where trained. Women Leader Trainings seek to transfer skills or build awerness of existing women leaders. ',' The Hunger Project aims to strengthen Unions for transparent, accountable and inclusive governance at the local level in order to accelerate the achievement of the SDGs. Activities foster a partnership between the people, their elected local government representatives and, wherever possible, the government functionaries at the grassroots in order to help achieve the SDGs. The centerpiece of The Hunger Project''s strategy is the local level training and ongoing support of nearly 270,000 volunteer Animators, 60 percent of whom are women, who organize mass action campaigns in their areas. As mentioned above, the animators focus their actions in clusters of villages known as unions and work closely with the elected local government bodies, holding trainings focused on gender issues and leadership to local women leaders. These leaders then proceed to organize local meetings, lead workshops and initiate campaigns against early marriage and dowry, malnutrition, maternal and child mortality, gender discrimination, and inequality, illiteracy and corruption. ',' The Hunger Project has been active in Bangladesh since 1990 and is currently active in 29 districts, reaching 4.5 million people. The Hunger Project’s strategies in Bangladesh occur on two scales: one focuses on the local landscape at the union level (as described above), the other on the national, with significant strategic overlap. At the national level, The Hunger Project addresses two pernicious cultural conditions that form major barriers to ending hunger in Bangladesh: youth development, gender discrimination and corruption. This is done through Youth Ending Hunger (YEH), the National Girl Child Advocacy Forum (NGCAF) and Shujan (Citizens for Good Governance). Thousands of students participate in the YEH program, which mobilizes students across the country to conduct national campaigns based on such issues as nutrition, education, family planning, tree planting and environmental education. The Hunger Project catalyzed the creation of the national alliance NGCAF, committed to ending all forms of discrimination against girls. Each year on September 30, this alliance organizes National Girl Child Day events across the country. A formal alliance of 300 organizations, the NGCAF also works to address domestic violence and the spread of HIV/AIDS. Shujan is a country-wide platform of committed, active and socially conscious citizens, mobilized by The Hunger Project, to strengthen grassroots democracy, ensure transparency and accountability of local government, and carry out advocacy initiatives at the national level. Shujan is also working for political and election reform.

    ('THP-BD-14-5923','The Hunger Project',NULL,'foodsecurity_site','Bahubal: SDG Union Strategy',' The Hunger Project-Bangladesh (THP) works in 185 Unions, Bangladesh’s smallest unit of rural government, to empower and mobilize both the local electorate and the elected Union Council through the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Union Strategy. The SDG Union Strategy is a demand-driven social development process in which communities move through phases of development at their own pace, self-directing and engaging in community priorities of their own choosing. The work proceeds through four phases: (i) Mobilization, (ii) Capacity Building, (iii) Taking action, and (iv) Assessing results. An SDG Union is a cluster of nine Bangladeshi villages that through partnership with THP has committed to achieving the SDGs at the local level. The SDGs will be achieved through increased engagement of active and informed citizens, enhanced democratic processes, and improved access to resources.The SDG Union Strategy looks to build volunteer-driven civil society from the bottom up, creating a shared vision for the union towards sustainable self-reliance and progress for all, driven by community mass-action.    The Bahubal Upazila is located in the Habiganj districit, inside the Sylhet division of Bangladesh. THP works in four unions in Bahubal: Mirpur, Putijuri, Bahubal and Satkapan, and 212 communities.',' The Hunger Project aims to strengthen Unions for transparent, accountable and inclusive governance at the local level in order to accelerate the achievement of the SDGs. Activities foster a partnership between the people, their elected local government representatives and, wherever possible, the government functionaries at the grassroots in order to help achieve the SDGs. The centerpiece of The Hunger Project''s strategy is the local level training and ongoing support of nearly 270,000 volunteer Animators, 60 percent of whom are women, who organize mass action campaigns in their areas. As mentioned above, the animators focus their actions in clusters of villages known as unions and work closely with the elected local government bodies, holding trainings focused on gender issues and leadership to local women leaders. These leaders then proceed to organize local meetings, lead workshops and initiate campaigns against early marriage and dowry, malnutrition, maternal and child mortality, gender discrimination, and inequality, illiteracy and corruption. ',' The Hunger Project has been active in Bangladesh since 1990 and is currently active in 29 districts, reaching 4.5 million people. The Hunger Project’s strategies in Bangladesh occur on two scales: one focuses on the local landscape at the union level (as described above), the other on the national, with significant strategic overlap. At the national level, The Hunger Project addresses two pernicious cultural conditions that form major barriers to ending hunger in Bangladesh: youth development, gender discrimination and corruption. This is done through Youth Ending Hunger (YEH), the National Girl Child Advocacy Forum (NGCAF) and Shujan (Citizens for Good Governance). Thousands of students participate in the YEH program, which mobilizes students across the country to conduct national campaigns based on such issues as nutrition, education, family planning, tree planting and environmental education. The Hunger Project catalyzed the creation of the national alliance NGCAF, committed to ending all forms of discrimination against girls. Each year on September 30, this alliance organizes National Girl Child Day events across the country. A formal alliance of 300 organizations, the NGCAF also works to address domestic violence and the spread of HIV/AIDS. Shujan is a country-wide platform of committed, active and socially conscious citizens, mobilized by The Hunger Project, to strengthen grassroots democracy, ensure transparency and accountability of local government, and carry out advocacy initiatives at the national level. Shujan is also working for political and election reform.

An SDG Union is a cluster of nine Bangladeshi villages that through partnership with THP has committed to achieving the SDGs at the local level. The SDGs will be achieved through increased engagement of active and informed citizens, enhanced democratic processes, and improved access to resources. The SDG Union Strategy looks to build volunteer-driven civil society from the bottom up, creating a shared vision for the union towards sustainable self-reliance and progress for all, driven by community mass-action.    The Sarankhola Upazila is located in the Bagerhat district, inside the Khulna division of southwestern Bangladesh. THP is active in four unions in Sarankhola: Royenda, Dhansagar, Khontakata, and Dakhin Khali, and in 44 communities. ',' The Hunger Project aims to strengthen Unions for transparent, accountable and inclusive governance at the local level in order to accelerate the achievement of the SDGs. Activities foster a partnership between the people, their elected local government representatives and, wherever possible, the government functionaries at the grassroots in order to help achieve the SDGs. The centerpiece of The Hunger Project''s strategy is the local level training and ongoing support of nearly 270,000 volunteer Animators, 60 percent of whom are women, who organize mass action campaigns in their areas. As mentioned above, the animators focus their actions in clusters of villages known as unions and work closely with the elected local government bodies, holding trainings focused on gender issues and leadership to local women leaders. These leaders then proceed to organize local meetings, lead workshops and initiate campaigns against early marriage and dowry, malnutrition, maternal and child mortality, gender discrimination, and inequality, illiteracy and corruption. ',' The Hunger Project has been active in Bangladesh since 1990 and is currently active in 29 districts, reaching 4.5 million people. The Hunger Project’s strategies in Bangladesh occur on two scales: one focuses on the local landscape at the union level (as described above), the other on the national, with significant strategic overlap. At the national level, The Hunger Project addresses two pernicious cultural conditions that form major barriers to ending hunger in Bangladesh: youth development, gender discrimination and corruption. This is done through Youth Ending Hunger (YEH), the National Girl Child Advocacy Forum (NGCAF) and Shujan (Citizens for Good Governance). Thousands of students participate in the YEH program, which mobilizes students across the country to conduct national campaigns based on such issues as nutrition, education, family planning, tree planting and environmental education. The Hunger Project catalyzed the creation of the national alliance NGCAF, committed to ending all forms of discrimination against girls. Each year on September 30, this alliance organizes National Girl Child Day events across the country. A formal alliance of 300 organizations, the NGCAF also works to address domestic violence and the spread of HIV/AIDS.

In some circumstances, a vulnerable family with a sick or malnourished baby can request that their baby is admitted temporarily into the Center in order to receive proper care until the baby’s health improves. Simultaneously, the social work department of the Center works with the parents/guardians to improve the living conditions of the family when the baby returns to its home.

There is also an integrated, public, special-education school on the DCC compound, run by the Kenyan government, to reach children with special needs. Most of the children who attend school here return to their families, who have received training by medical and therapy staff on care for their special-needs child at home on the weekends and holidays.

But rainfall has decreased and farmers are seeking other forms of income generation. Therefore, we will work to increase farmers’ income through more productive and sustainable agriculture systems like irrigation and poultry and livestock raising.Drought, deforestation, and poverty have left farmers and their families facing food shortages for up to six months every year. We will partner with the World Food Program and UNICEF to create a food for work program. Residents will build and repair roads and water pipes, and be paid with food for their families.Many children under five years old do not have access to a balanced diet. Therefore we will focus on nutrition education for families, emphasizing the importance of protein and vegetables for children during their early years.Children in remote areas often miss out on immunizations because there are not enough healthcare workers to travel to these hard-to-reach places. So we will train additional community health volunteers who will be able to serve these children and families.Families need education about malaria prevention and treatment. We plan to strengthen healthcare education at the household level, where knowledge is lacking.Water is scarce in the area, and people depend on streams for drinking water and irrigation. However, these streams dry up after the rainy season, and children have to travel up to three miles to find water. We will focus on creating additional water sources that provide children with this essential resource.Diarrhea and acute respiratory infections are prevalent for children under five because of unsafe water and poor hygiene. Very few families have a latrine. We will concentrate on training children and adults about personal hygiene, and will work to improve sanitation in the village.Children stop attending school after the primary level because middle and secondary schools are too far from the community. We will work with the Education Department to provide transportation and funding so students can continue their schooling.Students who drop out of school are more likely to become involved in dangerous and antisocial activities. Therefore, we will provide vocational skills training for youth so they can find employment and earn income.Although many parents recognize the importance of early childhood education, there are no preschools in the area and young children are therefore not prepared for primary school. So we will open preschools, provide supplies and teaching aids, and train teachers and management committees.Several parents are not educated and do not see the benefits of education for their children in terms of income and livelihood. We will work with the active local Parent Teacher Association (PTA) as they spread the word to others about the importance of education.During the rainy season, landslides can quickly wipe out farmers'' fields, which are planted on steep hillsides. These landslides cause families to lose their access to food and income, which affects the well-being of children due to impacts on school fees and nutrition. Therefore, we will work on disaster preparedness plans to prevent and reduce risk of landslides.Children continue to be victims of violence, exploitation, and abuse. We will improve our protection of vulnerable children through influencing policy makers and community leaders, and by creating effective systems to eliminate abuse, neglect, exploitation, and all other forms of violence.While parents of newborns have recently recognized the importance of obtaining birth certificates to ensure their child''s rights to education and citizenship, they may have missed this opportunity for their older children. We will work with community leaders to assist these parents in accessing this essential resource for all of their children.Children and youth are often ignored in community meetings, and their voices and opinions are considered inconsequential. We will form community groups where children and youth acquire and practice the skills of debate, communication, negotiation, and group decision-making.','This Development Program uses an innovative approach to programming.

The 26-year civil war was an outgrowth of a history of ethnic conflict – not a situation where one side was the devil and the other the angel. There were enormous combatant civilian losses and casualties, the majority affecting Tamils with Sinhalese and Muslims also suffering. Since the war ended with a violent defeat of the Tamil Tigers in 2009, the expected ‘peace’ has not materialized. The need to build trust and collaboration across ethnic communities has not been addressed, and there have been growing religious tensions. Throughout these past decades of conflict, there have been some faith leaders, primarily clergy, from Sri Lanka’s four religions – Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, and Christianity – working for conflict resolution, justice, and peace. Diocese of Colombo’s Social Action unit will build on the underutilized platform of faith communities and other sources of resilience. The proposed three-year project will engage faith leaders, particularly lay leaders, and members to expand their role in peacebuilding, developing their skills and a network for action – focused on sources of grievances and people’s current priorities. Clergy and lay leaders can be effective agents of peace, influencing the attitudes of the members of their faith institutions. They will serve as catalysts in their communities to work for social change on shared problems.

The consequences of food insecurity are far reaching with poor households using various copping means to minimize risk from drought hazards. However, copping means in turn have their own social and economic consequences. As a result of migration of household heads to neighboring countries or internal relocation to larger cities and townships, we are evidencing the disintegration of family structures. Children are either left behind, or left with grandparents to be looked after. HIV/AIDS has also left many to become orphaned adding to the mix of complex challenges that both children and caretakers face in having access to sufficient food in a region characterized by drought and chronic food insecurity. This food security program targets Orphans & Vulnerable Children (OVCs) and their caregivers having an overall objective of increasing household agricultural production for 200 households (with 1150 members) in 3 wards in Umguza District. The Program plans to introduce climate adaptive improved agricultural practices by using available resources (land, extension officers, agricultural inputs, water resources and training) for OVCs and caregivers to diversify food sources. Seed packs that are climate adaptive and to a larger extent require relatively less water and are early maturing will be provided to caregiver households. Tillage of land, in Zimbabwe is managed by the District Agricultural Mechanization Center. Caregiver families will be linked to the Center for tillage and land preparation to take place. Extension support will also be provided in partnership with the District Agricultural Office. The Diocese of Matabeleland will also avail land and water irrigation schemes for selected households that will be organized in groups to grow vegetables on a year round basis. It is expected that by increasing household agricultural production, caregivers will increase their income and cover basic needs related to education and food. The vegetable farms would also be a source of nitrous food for caregiver families enabling them to sell surplus produce at local markets. The diocese has previously been engaged in a food security and supplementary feeding schemes through provision of seed packs to vulnerable communities and also feeding of affected school children.

These latter components are the heart of El Porvenir''s focus which revolves around clean water within the community’s watershed. Water and sanitation go hand in hand to provide safe drinking water. Watershed protection helps protect water sources and keep the program sustainable in the long run. Health education is the key component that ensures the health gains from water and sanitation are fully realized as well as promoting a healthy watershed and sustainable environmental practices. In the last few years, El Porvenir''s reforestation program has evolved into a more focused watershed protection program. The principal beneficiaries of El Porvenir''s projects are rural women and children. The women’s principal concerns relate to health of themselves and their children. The burden for carrying water usually falls to women and children. Children can miss school because of the time needed to gather water or travel to wash clothes or themselves. In communities without an adequate water source, many families travel to nearby streams or creeks to wash and bathe and collect drinking water. Unfortunately, most of these sites do not provide potable water. Participants are active from the moment El Porvenir''s projects are conceived. El Porvenir does not offer projects; the communities must come to the organization. This ensures that beneficiaries take the necessary leadership from the beginning and will be more likely to maintain that leadership and ownership through the lifecycle of the project.

Aside from the persons directly infected by the disease, the general health and economic infrastructure in the country was greatly impacted. Many families in-country are without consistent sources of income and food. For the ADG, of it''s four health facilities, one was completely closed down and two lost critical staff posted by the government because the facilities lacked some basic amenities for care, thus placing the health workers themselves at risk. Essential medicines for treatment of diarrhea, malaria and pneumonia at the clinic level are non-available, eroding the system where community health workers are empowered to care and refer severe cases to these health centers. The Anglican diocese of Guinea, is seeking to inspire its diocesans and community members to begin the rebuilding of their lives and possibly from this point achieve greater independence and prosperity than was the situation before the disease outbreak hence this project named Anglican integrated development project for communities affected by Ebola. This project seeks to utilize the assets of the church in the form of over 100 hectares of unused farmlands to empower the diocesans to be able to build their own farms to generate income for the family, community and the church. The project shall support the ADG to develop a group formation structure by helping the participating community members form three farming groups. These groups would receive training in governance of the associations and logistical management. Once formed, delegates from each association and staff of ADG designated would have a participatory training session aimed at agreeing to the use of the land both to generate income, food and for use as a learning space from which all participants could learn something and replicate on their individual farms. This project would provide technical support in growing of identified specific crops for the season. The church has extensive farmlands in the Fallanghia area. Fallanghia is about 90 miles North east of Conakry in the Dubreka prefecture of Kindia province. Fallanghia is home to Guinea’s first Anglican church and the church here has farmlands covering about 100 hectares. These would be designated as model farms for three associations constituted around mothers, youth and men respectively. These farms would be cultivated in a climate smart manner. This project seeks to support the ADG to revive the coordination of community based health promotion and clinical referral. To achieve this, the project will refurbish one of the health centers administered by ADG in Fallanghia. The refurbished clinic would also be able to manage referred cases of diarrhea, pneumonia and malaria from the communities. It is envisioned that these interventions by the ADG would be sustainable in that the farms would generate income and food, and a portion of income would be set aside for reinvestment in the land and the program. The health facility will generate income from services, a proportion of which would be used to keep the facility functional.','Training in climate smart agriculture.

The Anglican Council played a significant role by mobilizing communities to become the frontline in the fight against malaria through traditional dances, drama, school club competitions and malaria open days and building capacity for project coordinators, health workers, and volunteers which created behavioral change interventions that encouraged sleeping under treated bed nets and early treatment seeking for malaria; and distribution of LLITNs to households, Engagement of stakeholders and community influential leaders facilitated community ownership. The initiative has promoted a community response to tackle malaria in the four dioceses of Anglican Council in Malawi through partnership with communities, National Malaria Control Program (NMCP), health workers, peer educators, other stakeholders and the main donor, Episcopal Relief & Development. Beside remarkable contribution made by Anglican Council malaria project in Malawi in reducing mortality and morbidity caused by malaria in the operation areas, malaria and other childhood illnesses namely pneumonia and diarrhea still remain the major causes of deaths of children under five in Malawi, accounting for 18%, 23% and 14% respectively (MDHS, 2010). Most of these deaths can be prevented if parents know the risk and ways to prevent and treat these diseases. Children need access to quality health care such as growth monitoring, immunizations, prevention, treatment and control of these major childhood illnesses. Malawi however faces many challenges, including widespread poverty, weak institutional and human capacity, limited resources because of competing needs, deep-rooted harmful traditional practices coupled with lack of adequate health knowledge and challenges in transportation to access early treatment for complicated illnesses. The Anglican Council in Malawi seeks to address Maternal, Neonatal and Child Health (MNCH) issues through an integrated service delivery. This will encompass health promotion & prevention (primary focused on interruption of the disease at the household level with strong emphasis on SBCC), and facilitation for curative interventions with multiple diseases particularly malaria, diarrhea and pneumonia in communities who otherwise lack easy access to case management in health facilities. As there is significant overlap of symptoms and high co-infection rates of the three major diseases affecting children under five years, the project intends to promote community health service delivery for these diseases through the Integrated Community Case Management (iCCM) strategy, which is endorsed by the Malawi Ministry of Health (MoH) and the National Malaria Control Program (NMCP). In 2016, ACM plans to implement an integrated community-based health program with a strong emphasis on Social Behavior Change Communication to help contribute to the improvement of maternal and child health. Key constituents of the program include LLIN distribution (universal coverage), distribution of Vitamin A supplements and deworming tablets to children under five and diagnosis and treatment for malaria, diarrhea and pneumonia for children under five. The mass nets distribution will cover the entire program areas; however, the iCCM piece and the distribution of vitamin supplements and deworming tablets will be implemented in four of the project sites. ACM hopes to scale up after about 3 years to include the other project sites based on the impact in the four pilot sites.','Facilitators conduct community mobilization and program promotion, Form Savings with Education groups, Training of trainers for staff on Savings with Education methodology, Train volunteers on Climate Change Preparedness and New methods of Agriculture, Supervise trained volunteers, Conduct a baseline survey, Conduct planning and review meeting with volunteers, CHAM, health workers to review project progress, Conduct biannual planning and review meetings with Diocesan project staff to review project activities and finances, Conduct quarterly supervisory visit to Dioceses for technical support and motivation, Conduct quarterly project visit to health workers, HSAs, volunteers and school patrons for technical support and motivation, Conduct follow up visits for 600 volunteers, Train 20 project staff and Environmental health officers on integrated community case management (iCCM) and Social Behavior Change Communication, Negotiate agreements in country with the health services and relevant stakeholders for commodities'' supply to HSAs, Regular coordination meetings with Ministry of Health and other health stakeholders, Procure iCCM drugs for the program, Improve referral system for HSAs to connect families to health facilities, Facilitate integration of HSAs data into Health Management Information Systems (HMIS),Community planning and action to solve transportation issues to health facilities, Conduct capacity building for 54 Health Surveillance Assistants (HSAs),Train 600 community volunteers on Integrated Community Case Management (iCCM),Diocesan Coordinators, Health Surveillance Assistants (HSAs) and volunteers reinforce key practices, adherence and referrals during home visits, focusing on mothers/primary caregivers, Distribute Vitamin A and Albendazole to children under five years, Conduct door to door follow up on nets usage to encourage consistent and correct usage of LLINs by beneficiaries, Conduct drama shows in communities on malaria, pneumonia and diarrhea, Commemorate World Malaria Day and other Special Health Events, Source and distribute 100,000 IEC materials on diarrhea, pneumonia and malaria, Sensitize community members on malaria, diarrhea and pneumonia, Distribute 1.2 million Long-lasting insecticidal nets to registered beneficiaries, Promote nutrition, WASH, disease prevention (diarrhea, malaria, pneumonia), signs/symptoms, appropriate home care, available treatments and when to seek those services',NULL,'2015-12-31 00:00:00','2020-01-31 00:00:00','Disaster Prevention and Preparedness|Economic Recovery and Development|Health','Disaster Risk Reduction',NULL,'AFN','31/12/2015',NULL,'Anglican Council in Malawi',NULL,2400000,NULL,'Individuals','People living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA), Community volunteers, Children < 5, Individuals','specific_locations','Malawi',NULL,NULL,'program@episcopalrelief.org',NULL,NULL,'2016-07-19 00:00:00','2019-07-30 00:00:00','active',NULL,'FALSE'),

Many households also have some degree of livestock production. The transition from subsistence to market economy is very slow due to various factors, such as: natural and man-made disasters (i.e. drought); inadequate social and economic infrastructures; poor access to agricultural technology, inputs and equipment; and very low education base. The rapid degradation of the environment is due to poor soil management, uncontrolled livestock grazing, deforestation, overpopulation and water shortages. By promoting Conservation Agriculture and the formation of Village Savings & Loans Associations (VSLAs), the long term goal of DCT-DSC is to help the people living within the Diocese to achieve food security in an economically and environmentally sustainable manner. Objectives are generally related to achieving self sufficiency in food grain production through use of minimum tillage, improved seeds, retention of crop residue, crop rotation and proper storage techniques. Both men and women will directly or indirectly benefit from the project in 6-8 villages within 4 parishes. Indirect beneficiaries are expected to be more numerous as most of the technologies are transferable by just copying or purchasing the inputs required.

Using its expertise in innovative and sustainable agricultural techniques, CEPAD staff is training small farmers in rural communities to make the best use of their land. Practices include planting of fruit trees such as plantain, banana, citrus, guava and passion fruit which can decrease erosion and provide a long-term source of food and income for the family. Farmers also receive inputs and training in planting maize, beans and cassava amongst the trees, in order to maximize the use of land and provide reliable annual staples for the household. Overarching this is the use of locally trialed soil improvement and conservation techniques, including household production of organic fertilizers and pesticides and construction of ridges and ditches to trap runoff and needed topsoil, and construction of rainwater harvesting structures called micro-dams to allow for production during the dry season. The program trains volunteer agriculture ''promoters'' in the communities, who in turn each train five ''disciples''. At least 1/3 of trainees are women. CEPAD undergoes a three year cycle with each group, and in 2016 is currently working with farmers in their second year.

PROCREEH is a new initiative that has grown out of the traditional microcredit activities of the Diocese of Haiti''s former development arm CEDDISEC. In 2013, in response to recommendations coming from a professional review and audit of former microcredit activities, Episcopal Relief & Development and the Diocese of Haiti joined together t support a new Manual of System Control and Administrative Procedures (MSCPA)- manuel de Systeme de Controle et de Procedures Administratives) and the opening of a designated Microcredit revolving Loan Account (at SOGEBANK). PROCREEH''s goal is to reinforce the autonomy of Haitian communities as leaders of their own socio-economic development. 2) Support to repair of Episcopal schools According to the last education census (2010-2011) available, of the thirteen thousand five hundred and ninety nine (13,599) écoles fondamentales (1st to 6th grade levels) identified, the non public sector schools represent 88% while the public sector has only 12% of total schools. Two hundred and forty-four (244) of these schools are owned and operated by the Episcopal Church in Haiti. Schooling at this age range (6-12 years old) is not something that happens systematically in Haiti. The Episcopal Church in Haiti has therefore a very important role to play in guaranteeing access to education to Haitian children. The population of children ages six (6) to twelve (12) years old who are in schools totals about. Only 60.93% of the school-age (6-12 years old) population is able to attend schools in Haiti. The access to education for this age group in Haiti is very problematic, either because of long walking distance required to get to school or inability of families to pay for the cost of education since most schools are not public. Nonetheless, Haitians parents are very committed to the education of their children. The World Bank estimates that Haitian parents spend on average $130 USD to send their children to school . Still, it is estimated that half a million children do not attend school. Haitian parents are willing to make extraordinary sacrifices to educate their children. Though many of the schools do not offer the children the tools necessary to compete in the 21st century. It can be argued that the learning environment is partly to be blamed in the deterioration of the school system in Haiti, as it does not allow the students to fully concentrate on learning. Some schools do not even have enough seats for the students that are enrolled. Although precise data is not available, it is generally known and accepted that many Haitian school infrastructures, including Episcopal schools are in very poor conditions. Taking into account the strong relation between an enabling learning environment and student achievement in disadvantage settings, investments in rehabilitation of Episcopal schools is essential in Haiti. Provision of quality facilities is a factor determinant of education outcomes. Therefore investment in improving quality of schools can contribute to positive education outcomes. In its quest to help tackle this issue, Episcopal Relief & Development puts in place a project aiming at improving education supply by improving the infrastructure, furniture for 11 existing Episcopal schools that were selected by the Diocese of Haiti. Through this project, Episcopal Relief & Development will not only enhance significantly the quality of school buildings; it will also provide new student places, therefore increase access. Increase in supply of education will be possible since these facilities will be able to offer basic education while providing required space per student. Increasing the supply of education in the communities will lessen the burden for families who will not have to turn to more expensive private schools to educate their children.','Introduce new Parishes in the PROCREEH.

ADS – Nyanza implemented Savings with Education (SwE) model with the aim of improving savings and increasing access to credit of rural women. The idea is to have households with economic power to address their livelihoods i.e. health, WASH, and food security challenges. From the business incomes, women have been able to address household livelihood issues like food security and better health services. This year, the program plans to strengthen and expand SwE education model to reach out to 3,000 rural women and youths with financial services. To enhance food security in the SwE targeted households, the program previously supported poultry value chain development. In this phase of the project, ADS – Nyanza targets to continue with supporting poultry value chain development and also to initiate and support bananas value chain development through technical capacity development, modern technology provision, market access and business support strategies. The program will ensure farmers are more agri-business inclined to produce for domestic consumption as well as market surplus quality farm produce after relevant trainings and linkage formation. The program will develop a matching input access package for the vulnerable households in which the project will support them with inputs equivalent to farmers own contribution as this will strengthen ownership and sustainability.

In this phase of the project covering 2015, ADS – Nyanza wishes to continue with implementation of this strategy and scale up HIV Testing and Counseling, Capacity building initiatives to PLWHIV and to increase their access to health services through the promotion of CBHF. ADS – Nyanza observed the need to engage more with the implementation of Integrated Community Case Management (iCCM) targeting children below 5 years of age. ADS – Nyanza intends to use the existing Government structures such as the Community Health Unit, CHW’s, CHEW’s, Health personnel and the existing community supply chains. ADS – Nyanza will therefore implement an intervention that seeks to empower the CHW’s to do conduct community case identification and management of the 3 mentioned childhood illnesses. Besides, ADS – Nyanza will build the capacity of CHW’s, CHEW’s, ECD volunteers, Mother to Mother support group members and the ministry of health personnel at Sub County and health facility level on Social Behavior Change Communication (SBCC). The intervention will help reduce childhood mortalities and also reduce health facility work load.','Quarterly Mother to Mother and ECD caregiver meetings, Hand washing Facilities installed in ECD centers, Registration of PLWHIV, Refresher Psychosocial Support, CHV Incentive Kit Distribution, Promotion meetings with leaders church leaders (Mothers Union, Youth chapter) disaggregated by group type, Training of replicators, Formation of Savings Groups, Management of overall savings portfolio, Financial and Business Management training, Community mobilization and targeting meetings, GAP Training, TOT Training, Establishment of model farms, Livestock Management Training, Livestock Upgrading Support, Farm Input Support, Stakeholders Meetings, Nursery Support, Mobilize and Induct identified church leaders as CBHF mobilizers, Outreach meetings to popularize CBHF/Social Marketing Day, Training of CBHF leaders on scheme management and risk monitoring, Sensitize SWE group members on diseases prevention, World Aids Day, SBCC/iCCM TOT Refresher Training (Includes messaging on skilled delivery, 4th ANC visit, and home visit training), CHW Refresher Training on ICCM, SBCC/iCCM TOT Refresher Training (Includes messaging on skilled delivery, 4th ANC visit, and home visit training), Mentorship for Men - Quarterly Meetings, Community Dialogue and Community Action Days, Malezi Bora Week',NULL,'2015-12-31 00:00:00','2021-12-31 00:00:00','Agriculture|Economic Recovery and Development|Health|Water Sanitation and Hygiene',NULL,NULL,'AFN','31/12/2015',NULL,'Anglican Development Services',NULL,13240,NULL,'Individuals','Individuals, Farmers','specific_locations','Kenya',NULL,NULL,'program@episcopalrelief.org',NULL,NULL,'2016-07-19 00:00:00','2017-12-13 00:00:00','active',NULL,'FALSE'),

The Program will continue to strengthen the churches farms as a means of sustaining the churches, as well as the community-based farm groups, thereby enabling them to generate income for their families and support their community development initiatives. Two Demonstration sites have been established and contain one oil palm nursery each and other mixed crops. The oil palm seedlings will be distributed to four local churches and the Diocese for their agro farms. Each local church after harvesting will set aside 30% of their sales to the Diocese to support the development initiatives of the Diocese. One of the Demonstration sites will be expanded for the purpose of establishing a seed multiplication site. The improved seeds and other crops will be distributed to the farming groups. Overall the two Demonstration sites will also be used to train farmers in new farming methods and techniques. In 2015 three churches and one farm community planted a total of 7,100 oil palm seedlings on 60.5 acres of land. It is expected that within the next 3-4 years when the oil palm is matured and harvested, proceeds would be used to support these churches and community in their development initiatives. Improved vegetable seeds and other crops were distributed to four farming groups, while two local churches and five farming groups received tools and other agricultural implements. The farms groups have been engaged in various agricultural activities ranging from cassava, rice and other vegetables production. The Program will continue to engage the communities to provide the land and labor to grow food crops that will be sold on the local market. In some cases the crops will be processed to add value, as a means of increasing the income of the farming groups. With an increase in their incomes, the various groups would be in the position to support their faming efforts by purchasing additional farming implements and other supplies needed to continue their farming activities. The Program will continue to provide technical support to these farming groups through the provision of farming implements and training to enable an increase in their yield, thereby supporting their community development initiatives and providing income to the groups and addressing their nutritional needs. The program will continue to support the Savings and Loan Project to build and strengthen savings and income for women, men, and their families, thereby contributing to the economic empowerment of their families. This program which started in February 2014 has economically changed the lives and living conditions of more than 4,149 women and their families. The Program intends to increase the number of Savings and Loan Groups from 31 to 42 with a membership of 1,010 persons. The Savings Groups will be encouraged to register with the County Savings and Loan Association as well as the National Village and Savings Loan Association. The Groups association with these bodies, will enable them have access to available micro loan and other economic empowerment services. Also, the Groups will be linked to the Agriculture activities as a means of increasing their incomes to enable them contribute to the development initiatives of their communities. In addition members of the various Savings and Loan Groups will receive training in basic GBV concepts and will be supported to form GBV Networks to prevent and respond to GBV related issues in their communities. The Ebola outbreak in Liberia adversely affected the program activities. The Program responded to the outbreak by providing the much needed Ebola prevention materials and supplies to affected Ebola communities, Ebola survivors, ETUs, as well as health centers and hospitals. In support of the Ebola Recovery Process, the Program will continue to focus on livelihood training and linking one Ebola affected community to agricultural activities. In addition, Religious leaders from both the Muslim and Christian faiths will be trained to work with their communities to prevent and respond to Ebola, avoid stigmatizing Ebola survivors and ensure their reintegration in their communities.','Procurement of demo sites Inputs (fertilizers, seeds, Knap-sack sprayer & tools).

Since the people affected directly or indirectly living in the tsunami areas had no access to finance from formal financial sources due to the lack of collateral, the ECLOF Lanka programme is one of the only avenues for beneficiaries to start up new activities that would generate income for sustainability. In 2013, ECLOF Lanka began a three-year programme replicating their same methodology in new target areas. ECLOF Lanka identifies clients in the marginalized areas by weighing heavily on the support and information from respective local government offices. At these local government offices are personnel identified for development of income- generating livelihood programmes. These persons assist in the formation of groups / societies of women’s along with the grass root Village Level Officer. These government agents conduct awareness programmes in the training of income generation projects with the assistance of social organizations and volunteer technical consultants. At the end of the third year, the capital fund revolves to new clients and part of the interest earned from loan recovery sustains the administrative and support costs. As the traditional wage earner in the family is the male, ECLOF Lanka''s efforts will have a direct impact on women as over 95% of loan recipients are women. This will give opportunities for the development of talents and empower women, as well as enhance the quality of food and educational facilities available to the children in the family. The first programme (6 years in total with 2 3-year projects) served 1,250 clients and the second 2013-15 third year programme served 810 client to enhance their income sources and improve their economic status. In 2016, ECLOF again begins another three-year partnership, this time in new resettlement area called Killinochchi following the 30-year civil war. Similar to the previous target areas, these clients have little access to external credit and ECLOF provides a valuable service to a target 400 clients.

As Public Health depends upon all (the whole population) being educated and engaged, not simply the members of the Anglican Church parishes and congregations, in 2011 under the Mothers’ Union leadership the project took on a new structure. This change charged the Mothers’ Union with the task of educating its members, who in turn would voluntarily work to educate the community. Over the next two years (2011 – 2012) 26 Mothers’ Union members were trained as trainers (Community Agents). These Community Agents in turn mobilized and trained 1,010 Mothers’ Union members as volunteer Activists that in turn engaged women in their neighborhoods to create community-based Learning Groups. Over that two-year period it was reported that 4,129 women in 55 communities had formed 608 Learning Groups where they met weekly to not only discuss issues contributing to better child and public health, but also take action in their homes, with their group members, and for their communities. In 2012, to improve responsiveness of the program to women’s current context requests for economic strengthening, the Mothers’ Union began researching the integration of a savings group component. This initially involved a March 2012 peer learning exchange with Mothers’ Union Burundi, followed by a November 2012 Savings with Education (SwE) Facilitators’ Workshop led by Episcopal Relief & Development and our technical partner Freedom from Hunger. In 2013, this new SwE component was launched in Luanda by 7 newly trained Facilitators. The results of this pilot year were the creation of 12 Savings Groups (through the combination of 28 learning groups) inclusive of 233 active members who saved a combined total of US$29,683 and earned a combined total of US$3,889 in benefits (interest and fines) for an end-of-year payout of US$33,572. Since then, the program has continued to grow, expanding throughout Luanda as well as to Uige Province. As of December 2015, the program encompassed 23 Trained Facilitators working with a total of 75 active Savings Groups with 1,892 active members (9% men) who in 2015 saved a combined total of US$394,605 and earned a combined total of US$46,422 in benefits (interest plus fines) for an end-of-year payout of US$441,028. In total, over the last three years the Mothers’ Union SwE program has led members to generate a three-year combined cumulated total payout of US$682,038 (this represents $610,669 in savings and $71,369 in earnings). This 2016 plan proposes to support the Mothers’ Union in their growth of the new Savings with Education component through the initiation and/or reinforcement of 106 Savings with Education Groups (i.e. 56 in Luanda, 50 in Uige). This includes: 11 4th year (2013 groups continuing), 33 3rd year (2014 groups continuing), 29 2nd year (2015 groups continuing), and 33 NEW groups to start in 2016 (i.e. 19 new in Luanda and 14 new in Uige).

It has been nearly 9 years that the ENP philosophy has been promoted by PEAC. The initial pilot phase under the leadership and guidance of Mosaic Creative (Bill Crooks’ UK-based consulting agency) began in 2008 in the three dioceses of Aru, Boga and North Kivu with the envisioning of provincial leaders and the subsequent 2009 formation of an initial 17 ENP facilitators. In 2011, PEAC’s provincial staff Fidèle Hamisi Mushamuka, Provincial Coordinator, and Reverend Martin Nguba, ENP Program Assistant, assumed leadership of the program’s promotion and expansion throughout the province. Since 2011, with the financial and technical support of Episcopal Relief & Development, the ENP program has seen both quantitative and qualitative improvements in results, including: - Formation of 10 national Trainers of ENP Facilitators for the self-promotion of ENP within the province. - Progressive provincial-led expansion of the program from 3 to all 9 dioceses in DRCongo. - Envisioning of over 335 leaders across the province. - Training of 293 active ENP facilitators, who in turn have encouraged the parish- and/or community-led initiation of 610+ development projects by 374 different ENP groups that include over 19,376 participating group members. - Development of an empowering and sustainable ENP program expansion plan that provides PEAC diocesan development teams with provincial accompaniment through three phases: Phase I: Envisioning and launch, i.e., initial religious leaders sensitization and training of a pilot group of ENP facilitators. Phase II: Equipping and expansion, i.e., strengthening diocesan ENP coordination teams through coaching, peer exchanges and networking, and administrative and logistical equipment. Phase III: Maturing and self-promotion, i.e., supporting diocesan ENP coordination teams to transition from provincial financial support to diocesan self-financing of future ENP promotion. - Development of tools for the reinforcement of both Provincial and Diocesan technical expertise in program monitoring, results tracking and the application of generally approved standards of accounting.

Over the years, AAP has worked with 10 parishes and 15 of their outstations reaching over 2,838 people in 32 communities in northern Namibia, many of which are located in remote areas beyond the reach of other social service programs. With these communities AAP facilitated the growth and educational outreach of Support Groups made up of individuals with HIV, volunteer Home-based Care Givers and general community members.

The largest barrier to the majority of these 13 million blind individuals regaining their sight is the shortage of trained eye care personnel to screen and treat them. To address this problem, our partners at SCEH in New Delhi, India have developed the innovative COP program. This program will train and educate mid-level medical personnel who can perform many of the same functions as an ophthalmologist, but have the advantages of a shorter training period and lower entry level education qualifications. However, there is something very unique about the mid-level training program at SCEH — it is made up almost entirely of young women from the surrounding rural areas.This program will train these young women to fulfill a variety roles as eye care personnel; including ophthalmic nursing assistants, vision technicians, medical records and registration, or patient counseling — in just 2 years of school. These positions will reduce the strain on higher-level personnel, like ophthalmologists, so that they can focus on sight-restoring procedures and surgeries.The COP program presents truly empowering opportunities to these young women that would otherwise not be available to them; the opportunity to be exposed to a new environment in urban Delhi outside rural villages, it teaches communication and life skills, and presents them with a healthy sense of self-esteem and self-worth.CBI’s role in this program is to provide stipends for the students. The stipends of $342 per year per student reduce the strain on their families and allow them to focus on their studies. For less than a dollar per day these living stipends give these young women the economic independence to fully pursue their education.Proposed Outcomes: <li>Average 37,500 surgeries per year at SCEH by 2020<li>Reduce the shortage of professionally trained ophthalmic personnel<li>Increase patient interactions in rural areas<li>Decrease gender inequality',NULL,NULL,'2014-01-01 00:00:00','2024-01-01 00:00:00','Education|Health',NULL,NULL,'USD','01/01/2014',NULL,'Dr. Shroff''s Charity Eye Hospital',NULL,NULL,NULL,'individuals','18-23 year old women','specific_locations','India>Delhi',NULL,NULL,'info@combatblindness.org','+1 (608) 238-7777','https://www.combatblindness.org/certified-ophthalmic-personnel-program/','2016-07-25 00:00:00','2017-04-03 00:00:00','active',NULL,'FALSE'),

At the present time some 6 million Syrians form the largest single group of refugees world-wide. It is estimated that to-date about 1¼ million Syrians reside within Jordan. The UNHCR registration figure of Syrian refugees in Jordan reached 657,206 persons. Approximately 83% live in urban areas in the north of Jordan, while the remaining proportion live in the Za’atari, Marjeeb al-Fahood, Cyber City and Al -Azraq Camps. In emergency situations, the needs of the disabled are generally neglected or considered a low priority by relief agencies and service providers. Even though disability is a cross-cutting theme which affects the entire refugee population it is often overlooked in all sectors, notably health and education. Most international relief organizations lack the specialist capacity to work with persons with disabilities. The Syrian refugee situation is no exception, as refugees entered to Jordan and were received initially in Za’atari camp none of the relief agencies operating there at the time offered appropriate services to the disabled. Refugee Disability Services HLID is a founding partner of the NETWORK, a coordinating organization of five local disability-specific organizations providing services throughout Jordon. The NETWORK has a proven track record of over 30 years of service provision and expertise. In December 2012, with Episcopal Relief & Development support, HLID expanded its NETWORK programme to serve the disability community in Za’atari camp. From December 2012 until April 2016, HLID has screen 5050 cases, assesses 3,751 cases, diagnosed 2,744 cases, provided 2,551 people with assistive devices, 1,454 with glasses, 822 with hearing aids and distributed 6,082 batteries, 224 splits, boots or chairs and 51 buggies for children with cerebral palsy or elderly persons with mobility issues. Additionally 70 children with different disabilities are enrolled in special education programmes at the NETWORK Center in Za’atari. In this 8-month project proposal, the HLID intends to expand its services furthermore to include Azraq camp in the Eastern desert of Jordan.

Social services are below the needs and the camp does not caters for persons with disabilities. Institutional Strengthening Since the start of the HLID’s Syrian refugee response, HLID has been able to deliver on partnership agreements in providing support to refugees with disabilities. In response, HLID has mobilized its institutional resources to establish, supervise and monitor these operational centers both at Za’atari camp and in mobile locations. While the donor community has funded the direct costs of these services, HLID has lent support in the form of expertise, human resources and in-kind contributions. With an expansion of services in ongoing refugee humanitarian crisis, HLID’s institutional capacity is stretched particularly as HLID strives to maintain the integrity and quality of their core programming as well. Therefore, a critical component of this proposal is capacity building of HLID, which includes hiring new staff, training, and logistical resources and supplies.','Provide 15 on the job training workshops to the CBRWs, Train 8 CBRWs on community rehabilitation work, humanitarian principals, child protection and sign language, Form 5 self-help family support groups, Conduct 50 disability awareness sessions, Hire full time project manager and administrator, Hire full time project accountant, Assess 500 cases for disability, Distribute devises to 350 persons with disability, Screen 700 cases for disability, Diagnose 415 cases for disability, Training of 350 persons with disability on use of devices, Purchase, refurbish and equip 3 caravans as a base for the provision of services, Obtain land from the United Nations (UNHCR) & fence the boundary, Purchase, refurbish and equip caravans for provision of services, Recruit a community-based rehabilitation worker to run the center',NULL,'2016-08-31 00:00:00','2020-01-31 00:00:00','Capacity Strengthening for CSOs (general)|Humanitarian Aid|Protection','Institution Strengthening',NULL,'AFN','31/08/2016','Holy Land Institute for the Deaf',NULL,NULL,10311,NULL,'Individuals','Individuals, Staff, People with Disabilities','specific_locations','Jordan>Az Zarqa''|Jordan>Al Balqa''',NULL,NULL,'program@episcopalrelief.org',NULL,NULL,'2016-11-23 00:00:00','2019-07-30 00:00:00','active',NULL,'TRUE'),

Inspired by the values of common faith, CAPA proclaims and acts on the agenda of spiritual, social, political and economic transformation, hence harvesting all the initiatives of the Church to re-articulate her prophetic mandate in the midst of the contradictions facing Africa and the World. Over the years, CAPA has developed and successfully implemented various programs and plans in response to the needs of the Provinces and Dioceses. Through a consultative process CAPA has developed their current strategic plan (2011- 2015) that focuses on: 1- Formation of compassionate and Accountable leadership; 2- Healing forgiveness and renewal for just and peaceful society; 3- Stewardship of resources for socio-economic emancipation; 4- Advancement of critical theological reflection and action; 5- Community health and HIV and AIDS; and 6- New frontiers of advocacy and discernment. 2016 is CAPA’s transitional year between their former and new strategic plan.

In post-conflict countries like Liberia the challenges of tackling and changing attitudes, behaviors and cultural norms are exacerbated by the previous experiences of widespread violence. While government efforts are understandably focused on providing services to and justice for survivors; it is often civil society organizations, particularly faith-based ones that tackle attitudes and behaviors that can contribute to violence. Faith institutions, clergy and lay leaders, are uniquely positioned to promote attitudes and behaviors that prevent violence and create an enabling environment for survivors. Clergy engage with couples, families, youth, men and women leaders in a variety of ways during their lives and guide knowledge, attitude and behavior change quite closely. Through sermons, religious teachings, marriage preparation, marriage counseling, family counseling, retreats, and revivals, clergy will influence the cultural and behavioral norms prevalent in a community. Lay leaders will also be trained as agents of change and then facilitate learning-action dialogues with members. Training and equipping youth leaders and engaging particularly male teens is a critical key to the project''s success – as engaging adolescents is a prime period for shaping attitudes about gender roles, interpersonal conflict resolution and other drivers for prevention of VAW/G. The Christian and Muslim youth movements in Liberia are strong and active and will serve as a vital asset in the project. Episcopal Relief & Development and our long-term Liberian partner, the Episcopal Church of Liberia Relief and Development have a proven track record in social behavior change communication and programs that address malaria prevention and control, agricultural development and rehabilitation, and education. The church will link these experiences and networks to more traditional faith based counseling and teaching formats and knowledge of other faith based institutions to address the root behavior and cultural norms underlying VAW/G and impunity for perpetrators. Faith-based organizations will engage all at the local level to map and network with available services for violence survivors and serve as referral sources to connect them. They will also organize assistance to help survivors overcome obstacles to receiving needed services. In this way, they expect to mitigate the challenges of providing integrated services particularly in rural areas where disperse populations, poor transportation, and lack of coordinated information is the norm. ERD and ECL-RD’s close collaboration with the government and other key stakeholders on GBV will also increase the project’s reach and effectiveness. In areas where there are inadequate services, and as a member of the Ministry of Gender and Development’s GBV Task Force, ECL-RD will advocate for additional government and other stakeholder support to fill gaps in needed services across the continuum. The project has four key areas of intervention: 1. Developing capacities of community groups and leaders – the project engages leaders and members of faith groups, each church and mosque has a men’s group, a women’s group, a youth group, and some also have a girls’ faith group. 2. Engaging new partners – men and boys through faith groups, and traditional leaders. 3. Changing individual knowledge and attitudes – the starting point is clergy, lay leaders, faith group members, congregants, and traditional leaders. The positive influence will also target cultural norms and behaviors related to prevention of violence and support to survivors. 4. Enhancing multi sectorial referral systems – the local faith-based organizations and project staff will disseminate information about available services and provide referrals at the community level, connecting to district, county, and national levels. The project will implement evidenced-based strategies for social & behavior change. An adaptation of the BEHAVE Framework (from the Academy of Educational Development) includes barrier analysis so that specific drivers and motivations can be targeted in the messaging developed. Clergy and lay leaders will be trained in the Facts, Association, Meaning and Action Learning-Dialogue approach (FAMA), which they will then facilitate with their group members.','Field test modules from faith leader toolkit with end users at county level, B.

One component includes the emergency response following the outbreak of violence in December 2013, and the second component relates to the operational management and restructuring of the SUDRA organization. With the outbreak of violence on December 15, 2013, the young nation of South Sudan has been engaged in a defacto civil war between forces loyal to the current President, Salva Kir and the former Vice President Riek Machar. Although attempts at cessation of hostilities have been partly successful, various new militant groups have emerged and the security situation continues to be very fluid. Within this context, The Episcopal Church of South Sudan and Sudan, commissioned an Emergency Crisis Committee under SUDRA. SUDRA/ECC serves to oversee and provide technical assistance to the relief activities facilitated by SUDRA. As SUDRA is designed as a coordinating body and an implementing agency, the emergency response has relied heavily on the diocesan DRR teams, which Episcopal Relief & Development had trained several years ago. This is a positive development and demonstrates the practical application of the training. SUDRA''s Emergency Response is supported by various funding agencies, coordinated by the Anglican Alliance. Episcopal Relief & Development is playing a critical role as the lead agency in this collaborative effort. 2016 saw the end of the Emergency Response with the completion of the impact and process evaluation. The second component of our partnership is the continued support of the SUDRA organization. In 2016, Episcopal Relief & Development is funding about 30% of the administrative budget of the SUDRA office (down from 40% in 2015). Episcopal Relief & Development supported a strategic planning process in 2013, and out of that process the SUDRA Board has adopted several new policies and procedures that served to restructure SUDRA operations. New leadership was also recruited. With a new strategic plan and new leadership, a key objective of 2016 is the build ownership of SUDRA at the diocesan level through the accompaniment of disaster response efforts. While the larger Emergency Crisis Appeal has closed, there are smaller skirmishes in more isolated dioceses that SUDRA will provide technical assistance and build diocesan relationships. A final key component of the 2016 plan, is for the SUDRA to oversee the final activities of the Health Commission as the multi-partner program ends in 2016. This programme is also funded by the Anglican Board of Mission-Australia.

ACT passed a resolution during the 2014 Synod in line with its "New Vision for Development", which involves professionalizing and rebranding as "Anglican Community Development Services (ACDS)". During the 2015 Synod the National Plan of Zonal Model was approved by the Standing Committee. In 2016, ACT developed a written proposal for facilitating the process of clustering the Province''s 27 dioceses into 5 development zones (i.e. Central, North Eastern, Southern, Western and Lake Zones). This zonal approach brings together all of the different departments of the Dioceses to work together within a common framework. This approach allows for greater opportunities in terms of amassing and attracting funds for development programs; providing a larger and more diverse pool of talent, skills and experience of Diocesan staff and other local stakeholders; achieving and demonstrating positive results, sustainable impact and scale with community development programs.

The second phase was the scale up to three other Dioceses in 2013, namely Luapula, Lusaka and Eastern which ended on 31st December, 2016. In 2017, ZACOP will be implementing an Interim Integrated Early Childhood Development Program for Children Affected by HIV/AIDS for a bridge period of six months. The key areas of focus for the Interim Six-month period (January to June 2017) is to strengthen caregiver/ volunteer engagement and ownership of the ECD Program in order to enhance improve community activity performance for impact results. In order to achieve this, a new set of activities will be carried out in addition to the routine activities. The transition strategy for the interim six month period foresees the continuation of ongoing ECD activities with some variations on program timeframes between new and older Dioceses leading to changes in frequency of home visits. The transition strategy is grounded on continued learning, innovation and piloting that will enable key stakeholders to manage and own the ECD Program while at the same time providing continued services to caregivers and their children. - Integrating nutrition assessment with ECD through ongoing health services (growth monitoring), home visitations, care giver support and learning group sessions will enable the Program to attain scale and maintain effectiveness. Detecting the early on-set of malnutrition together with referral; treatment and counseling can avert and reduce the incidence of wasting (Marasmus) and edematous malnutrition (kwashiorkor) averting and reducing the negative longer term consequences. -

The main objective is to improve the nutritional status of 1000-days women and children, those in the period between conception and a child’s second birthday. A combination of nutrition-specific and nutrition-sensitive interventions will be implemented throughout 40 of Nepal’s 75 districts. The five main program areas are maternal and child nutrition; maternal, newborn, and child health services; family planning; water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH); and agriculture/homestead food production (HFP).  Furthermore, social and behavior change communication (SBCC) approaches adapted to each location, a focus on gender and social inclusion (GESI), and routine monitoring, evaluation, and research for learning and programmatic strengthening provide the basis for all Suaahara II interventions. Together, these elements are expected to improve nutritional well-being in rural Nepal.Suaahara II will continue to work in all VDCs in 38 of Suaahara I’s districts, but two new districts have also been added: Dhading and Panchthar. The estimated total target population of 1000-day women and children for Suaahara II is approximately 1.5 million. Suaahara II will also target indirect beneficiaries, such as mothers-in-law and husbands, who also play a critical role in maternal and child nutrition. In selected districts, Suaahara II will also work with adolescent girls to improve their understanding of nutrition, hygiene and reproductive health, and with adolescent boys to influence gender and other social norms. Disadvantaged households will continue to be prioritized for all interventions. To reach these different target groups, Suaahara II will build the capacity of frontline workers (FLWs) to promote behavior change and use of health services. Activities in 15 of these districts will be transitioned to government management in year three. Suaahara II will work closely with the Department of Health Services to plan a systematic, phased handover, based on mutually agreed criteria.Suaahara II and the Government of Nepal (GoN) work in collaboration for all activities. At the national level, Suaahara II supports line ministries to ensure nutrition-sensitive policies, guidelines, and materials, with consideration of GESI issues and to design and implement key programmatic inputs such as the episodes for Bhanchhin Aama, a weekly radio drama broadcast on 45 national and subnational radio stations. At the district level, Suaahara II works with GoN departments to plan and budget for nutrition, agriculture, health and WASH interventions and to generate support among key stakeholders for multi-sector nutrition programing. Suaahara’s largest footprint is at the village level where a cadre of around 600 field supervisors work with village development committees to train, jointly supervise and build the capacity of FLWs from Suaahara-related sectors. These FLWs are Suaahara’s primary modality for reaching target households.','Suaahara II has the following objectives:•  To improve household nutrition and health behaviors. These behaviors include optimal maternal, infant and young child nutrition (MIYCN) practices; healthy timing and spacing of pregnancies (HTSP); and improved water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) practices. This will be achieved via an intensive approach to social and behavior change, including increasing the number of interpersonal contacts with each beneficiary and using formative research to hone more effective messages and define supporting actions.•  Increase the use of quality nutrition and health services by women and children. This will be achieved through implementation of Nutrition Assessment Counseling and Support (NACS) by all health providers; improved quality and coverage of Community-Based Integrated Management of Neonatal and Childhood Illnesses (CB-IMNCI); fostering quality reproductive health services; better health management information system (HMIS) and strengthening outreach clinics to bring services closer to the community.•  Improve women’s and children’s access to diverse and nutrient-rich foods. Suaahara II will work with communities to increase homestead food production of nutrient-dense plant and animal foods, and create resilience to nutrition shocks caused by climate change and natural disasters. Market linkages will be developed in collaboration with the KISAN and PAHAL3 projects to allow marginalized communities to generate income from surplus produce, coupled with promoting the use of income to improve food security and nutrition. Social behavior change strategies will support increasing women’s household decision making.•  Accelerate the rollout of the Multi-sector Nutrition Plan (MSNP) through strengthened local governance.

When we started in 1984, we focused almost exclusively on bringing mobile eye camps into villages. During these camps, people would receive vision screenings (some for the very first time in their lives), and then those who needed surgery would receive it right there in the camps. The surgeries took only minutes and cost less than $10. Our patients would have their cataracts removed and then receive thick lens glasses that would allow them to see.But the system wasn’t perfect. If a person lost or broke their glasses, they were once again left blind. The problem was that intraocular lenses (the clear lens that’s inserted into the eye during surgery that allows people to see without glasses) cost hundreds of dollars – far too much money to be used widely for patients who couldn’t pay.So, in 1992, Combat Blindness International partnered with two other like-minded organizations and found Aurolab. Aurolab is the manufacturing division of the highly-respected Aravind Eye Hospital in Madurai, India. Aurolab began producing intraocular lenses and provided those lenses to us at a cost of roughly $2.With these low-cost lenses, Combat Blindness International’s medical partners were able to provide the same surgeries to their poorest patients that were previously only possible on those who could pay.The results are remarkable. After a simple surgery, men, women and children are able to spend their lives with clear vision without the need for glasses that could be lost or broken.To this day, we still help provide low cost cataract surgeries for the poor, however the price has increased over the years since we first started using Intraocular Lenses. We are proud to state that through our strong partnerships, we can still keep them affordable.

Through this fully integrated development strategy, community members establish and manage their own programs to address food security, nutrition, health, education, microfinance, water and sanitation. Epicenters follow four distinct phases over a period of about five to eight years on a path toward to sustainable self-reliance. Majete 4 is currently in Phase 1, during which communities are mobilized to participate in Vision, Commitment and Action Workshops to develop their own vision of a different future, and local volunteers, called “animators,” create action plans for moving forward. ',' The Hunger Project promotes a holistic approach to food security, and many of its activities contribute to increased access to sufficient food but also improved diets, greater nutritional variety and stronger ties to local resources. For example, epicenter preschools provide hot, nutritious meals to students and epicenter rural banks offer loans and savings products that often increase the amount and quality of food at the household level. Most importantly, THP trains animators, who, with support from existing local and government institutions (farmers’ cooperatives, agricultural extension workers) hold trainings in farming technologies (row planting, field rotation), seed and soil types, and low-input yield-improving techniques (organic compost, microdose fertilizer application). The trainings take place at the epicenter demonstration farm, where crops are grown for consumption by the community and distribution to local school meal programs. ',' Additionally, THP implements an Agriculture Revolving Loan Fund. Through this fund, participating local farmers access seed and fertilizer loans at the start of the planting season. These loans are repaid post-harvest through in-kind reimbursement of bags of grain. This grain can then be sold at a fair price to the community over the lean season, not only improving food security but also re-capitalizing the loan fund for future lending. Lastly, THP works with each community to construct a secure and treated community food bank, which can store the harvest from the demonstration farm, reimbursements from the Agriculture Revolving Loan Fund, and even individual harvests for safe-keeping. The food bank is managed by a local Food Security Committee, which oversees the operations of the entire program; each committee is made up of equal numbers of men and women and is democratically elected by the epicenter populations.

The strategies aim to build the capacities of individual EWRs and an enabling environment for them to exercise their leadership effectively. The Hunger Project facilitates the leadership of these women leaders with key interventions in each year of their five year tenures: Year One: Conduct Women''s Leadership Workshops (WLW) and follow-up to strengthen skills of women leaders and create bottom-up plans for villages to meet basic needs ; Year Two:Provide technical inputs through need based workshops (NBW) and facilitate the formation of federations at the cluster and block level; Year Three:Foster awareness among the community about their rights and issues within the Panchayats ; Year Four:Focus on strengthening local and state level advocacy to overcome bureaucratic obstacles and ensuring the successful implementation of plans, and; Year Five: Carry out campaigns to encourage participation of women as voters and as candidates in the run-up to elections.                                                                                                                                                                                             The Hunger Project has been working with elected women representatives in the state of Bihar since 2001, having organized a workshop with EWRs and Civil Society Organizations immediately following Panchayat elections. Work with EWRs eventually progressed to Women’s Leadership Workshops, adopting the five-year planned cycle in 2005. The Hunger Project has successfully prevented the implementation of the Two-Child Norm in Panchayats in Bihar. The Two-Child Norm, ostensibly an effort at curbing population growth, is a legal provision that systematically prevents the participation of female representatives with more than two children.   ',' The Hunger Project, in partnership with many local civil society organizations, has trained more than 79,000 elected women representatives. Examples of the activities within this strategy include:    Empowering Women in Elections: To encourage voter participation among women and nominations of potential women leaders, The Hunger Project conducts intensive pre-election campaigns. SWEEP (Strengthening Women''s Empowerment in Electoral Processes) campaigns include meetings, film screenings, street plays, door-to-door contacts, trainings and distribution of posters and pamphlets.    Federations for Advocacy and Mutual Empowerment: To empower women leaders and their communities, The Hunger Project supports the formation of federations among their elected leaders to voice their concerns as a collective unit.    Mobilizing the Media to Support Women Leaders: To highlight the work of women leaders and Panchayati Raj, The Hunger Project actively engages with the media and annually awards the Sarojini Naidu Prize, showcasing the efforts being made by the elected women and recognizes three journalists reporting on their work in Hindi, English and other Indian language categories. ',' The Hunger Project has been active in India since 1984 and currently works across seven states, 54 districts, and more than 2000 village clusters (panchayats). In response to the 73rd Amendment to the Indian Constitution that mandated that one-third of all seats in panchayats be reserved for women, The Hunger Project developed its comprehensive strategy, the Panchayati Raj Campaign. The Hunger Project''s approach of mobilizing people for self-reliant action, empowering women as key change agents and engaging with local government has provided the solid foundation upon which to expand local development initiatives throughout the seven states of India in which THP is present.

Integrating youth into the licit workforce requires that they are “workforce ready,” meaning they have the required soft and technical skills, knowledge, and capabilities to succeed.The term “soft skills” refers to the range of skills, competencies, behaviors, attitudes, and personal qualities that prepare a person to enter into and succeed in the workplace and that are neither academic nor technical. As part of a positive youth development (PYD) approach, the ETP team, led by Plan, must address and quantifiably measure the development of soft skills, developmental assets, and protective factors among target at-risk youth. The Subcontractor will be required to measure the attainment the key soft skills highly correlated to positive workforce outcomes: social skills, communication skills, and higher order thinking.

    ('6170-21213','World Bicycle Relief','6170','Innovation','Bicycles for Educational Empowerment (BEEP)','WBR’s Bicycles for Educational Empowerment Program (BEEP) approach is built on three pillars designed to promote program sustainability and impact: partnership, capacity building, and a high quality bicycle designed for rural Africa.WBR leverages the local expertise of partner NGOs that implement educational programs at community level addressing student retention, attendance and performance outcomes, but face the challenge of distance. The partner forms a Bicycle Supervisory Committee (BSC) composed of school officials, members of the PTA, community and church leaders and traditional leaders. In addition to raising awareness about girls'' education, the BSC manages the project, the WBR-trained Field Mechanic, and ensures beneficiaries living far from school are selected based on low attendance, punctuality, vulnerability, age, and gender. WBR targets girls to receive 70% of bicycles. The BSC ensures selected students sign study-to-own contracts, which state the bicycle becomes his/her property if primarily used and maintained for accessing education. After successful sensitization about BEEP, the BSC has capacity in project, resource management and community-based monitoring and evaluation.WBR provides a superior bicycle designed based on end-user feedback from nine years of operating health and education projects in Africa. The Buffalo Bicycle has a reliable front and rear braking system, a reinforced fork and a strong rear carrier that holds up to 100 kg.Children walking long distances to school face many challenges including increased tardiness, exhaustion, and safety risks. Adolescent girls, in particular, are at risk for complete withdrawal from the educational system. Research shows that education is an essential element to end the cycle of disease (like HIV) and poverty. While the scope of the problem is broad, one strategy to increase student attendance, enrollment, and retention is safe, reliable transportation to school. BEEP provides durable, reliable bicycles, primarily to girl students, to significantly reduce their travel time to school. BEEP achieves sustainable program impact through: i) partnership with reputable NGOs; (ii) creation of a diverse committee enabling deep community involvement; (iii) incentivizes bicycle maintenance and care and school attendance through study-to-own contracts signed by students and parent; and (iv) training bicycle mechanics, ensuring bicycles remain in good working order.BEEP is: 1) a cost effective way to improve educational outcomes for adolescent girls; 2) a sustainable solution leading to long-lasting change, and 3) an appropriate technology to address long distances rural students in Africa face. Using a quality, durable bicycle to improve access to education is both simple and more cost effective than constructing schools or introducing dedicated buses or taxis. At the core of program design is recognition that the local community has to embrace BEEP for success.The creation of the Bicycle Supervisory Committee (BSC) lies at the heart of this community-based approach. By involving local leaders, the program gains legitimacy and ensures the bicycles remain in use for improving access to school. The bicycle distribution and handover ceremonies highlight the importance of the bicycles, reward the students and enable the BSC to show their leadership.The bicycle design is innovative in its unique balance of quality and durability while remaining cost-effective. WBR continuously tests and improves the design of the Buffalo Bicycle. Bicycle components are durable, readily repairable with very basic tools, and compatible with locally available spares. Competing bikes in the market are low cost and low quality or much more expensive, but designed to be lightweight rather than tough.

As Tembaro Woreda and other districts of Kembata Tembaro Zone face many challenges to improving maternal and neonatal health outcomes, including a shortages of midwives, in 2012 WEEMA partnered with the Tembaro Woreda Health Office and Hamlin College of Midwives to select four young women from Tembaro to become students at the Hamlin College of Midwives. WEEMA sponsored the tuition and affiliated expenses required for them to complete this high quality midwifery training in Addis Ababa. The midwife scholars graduated from Hamlin College of Midwives in October 2016 and began their four year deployment as “Expert Hamlin Midwives” in Tembaro Woreda. In partnership with the midwives and local government, this project is designed to fully utilize the midwives’ knowledge and skills, including training and skills transfer to other health workers in Tembaro.The midwives are providing skilled delivery and reproductive health services to women  in local health facilities. To expand the knowledge and skill base of existing health care workers, midwives will be responsible for training, supervising and ensuring health workers follow protocols when caring for mothers and newborns. In addition, a training space in Mudula Town, as identified by government partners, will be established for the Expert Hamlin Midwives to train health workers from Kembata Tembaro Zone. Midwives will also work to have a regular presence in the community by leading and facilitating discussions and sessions regarding behavior change education. While the Woreda Health Office provides standard salary and benefits to the midwives, WEEMA provides additional support to enable the midwives to fully contribute their knowledge and skills to the betterment of MNCH health services in Temaro Woreda. Some WEEMA support will be in the form of infrastructure improvements (e.g. equipment) to health facilities, while others are intended to be retention mechanisms/motivation methods to keep the Expert Hamlin Midwives highly active over the four years.','This project is part of WEEMA’s goal to reduce maternal, neonatal and child morbidity and mortality.

The long-term goal of this project is for girls to be free to decide if, when and whom to marry.Aiming for gender equity (equal access, possibilities and treatment) is at the core of all our interventions and our organisational policies. In addition, we promote the inclusion of marginalised and disadvantaged groups in our programme. Special focus is given to girls hiding at home, disabled girls, children of minorities and the poorest of the poor. </p? Our strategies focus on increasing girls’ control on decision-making regarding issues that shape their lives, and their access to opportunities such as education, health care and income generation; and mobilising relevant community actors as change agents to address underlying factors, beliefs and processes leading to child marriage.  The key intervention areas are investing in girls, their knowledge, their skills and their participation in society; improving access to formal education for girls; improving access to youth-friendly sexual and reproductive health services for girls; improving the economic security of girls and their families; mobilizing communities to transform social norms that are detrimental to achieving gender equity; and creating an enabling legal and policy environment on preventing child marriage.

For example, epicenter preschools provide hot, nutritious meals to students and epicenter rural banks offer loans and savings products that often increase the amount and quality of food at the household level. Most importantly, THP trains animators, who, with support from existing local and government institutions (farmers’ cooperatives, agricultural extension workers) hold trainings in farming technologies (row planting, field rotation), seed and soil types, and low-input yield-improving techniques (organic compost, microdose fertilizer application). The trainings take place at the epicenter demonstration farm, where crops are grown for consumption by the community and distribution to local school meal programs. ',' Additionally, THP implements an Agriculture Revolving Loan Fund. Through this fund, participating local farmers access seed and fertilizer loans at the start of the planting season. These loans are repaid post-harvest through in-kind reimbursement of bags of grain. This grain can then be sold at a fair price to the community over the lean season, not only improving food security but also re-capitalizing the loan fund for future lending.','2016-01-01 00:00:00','2024-12-31 00:00:00','Agriculture|Economic Recovery and Development|Education|Health|Water Sanitation and Hygiene','Economic Recovery & Development, Education, Environment, Gender, Health, HIV/AIDS Nutrition, Water Sanitation & Hygiene, Child Marriage',NULL,'USD','01/01/2016',NULL,NULL,'The Hunger Project',NULL,17194,'Individuals','Women; Children Under 5; Women of reproductive age; Small farmers; Elected officials','regional','Ethiopia>Amhara','Tory Watts','Senior Director, Program Strategy & Operations','victoria.watts@thp.org','212-251-9121','http://www.thp.org/ethiopia','2018-05-16 00:00:00','2018-05-16 00:00:00','active','Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs','FALSE'),

Gender inequality fuels the incidence of child marriage, and unequal gender power relations are reproduced in marriages between young girls and older men. Although it is difficult to challenge existing beliefs regarding gender and gender roles, doing so is the core of our work. Our vision is to work towards a world where girls and women enjoy equal status with boys and men, and are able to achieve their full potential in all aspects of their lives. The long-term goal of this project is for girls to be free to decide if, when and whom to marry.Aiming for gender equity (equal access, possibilities and treatment) is at the core of all our interventions and our organisational policies. In addition, we promote the inclusion of marginalised and disadvantaged groups in our programme. Special focus is given to girls hiding at home, disabled girls, children of minorities and the poorest of the poor. </p? Our strategies focus on increasing girls’ control on decision-making regarding issues that shape their lives, and their access to opportunities such as education, health care and income generation; and mobilising relevant community actors as change agents to address underlying factors, beliefs and processes leading to child marriage.  The key intervention areas are investing in girls, their knowledge, their skills and their participation in society; improving access to formal education for girls; improving access to youth-friendly sexual and reproductive health services for girls; improving the economic security of girls and their families; mobilizing communities to transform social norms that are detrimental to achieving gender equity; and creating an enabling legal and policy environment on preventing child marriage.Gezawasha Epicenter is currently in Phase 2,  during which L-shaped epicenters are built.

The Hunger Project facilitates the leadership of these women leaders with key interventions in each year of their five year tenures: Year One: Conduct Women''s Leadership Workshops (WLW) and follow-up to strengthen skills of women leaders and create bottom-up plans for villages to meet basic needs ; Year Two:Provide technical inputs through need based workshops (NBW) and facilitate the formation of federations at the cluster and block level; Year Three:Foster awareness among the community about their rights and issues within the Panchayats ; Year Four:Focus on strengthening local and state level advocacy to overcome bureaucratic obstacles and ensuring the successful implementation of plans, and; Year Five: Carry out campaigns to encourage participation of women as voters and as candidates in the run-up to elections     The Hunger Project has been working with elected women representatives in the state of Rajasthan since 2001, holding women’s leadership workshops and building capacity among elected women representatives from eight districts across the state. The Hunger Project has focused on expanding partnerships at the grassroots level, enabling a larger percentage of elected women representatives in various districts to be engaged through the Women’s Leadership Workshops.     Jaipur is a district in the western state of Rajasthan. THP works in 37 Gram Panchayats in one block in Jaipur: Chaksu. In 2016, 4 Need Based Workshops took place, with 135 Elected Women Representatives participating.

SWEEP (Strengthening Women''s Empowerment in Electoral Processes) campaigns include meetings, film screenings, street plays, door-to-door contacts, trainings and distribution of posters and pamphlets.    Federations for Advocacy and Mutual Empowerment: To empower women leaders and their communities, The Hunger Project supports the formation of federations among their elected leaders to voice their concerns as a collective unit.    Mobilizing the Media to Support Women Leaders: To highlight the work of women leaders and Panchayati Raj, The Hunger Project actively engages with the media and annually awards the Sarojini Naidu Prize, showcasing the efforts being made by the elected women and recognizes three journalists reporting on their work in Hindi, English and other Indian language categories. ','The Hunger Project has been active in India since 1984 and currently works across seven states, 54 districts, and more than 2000 village clusters (panchayats). In response to the 73rd Amendment to the Indian Constitution that mandated that one-third of all seats in panchayats be reserved for women, The Hunger Project developed its comprehensive strategy, the Panchayati Raj Campaign. The Hunger Project''s approach of mobilizing people for self-reliant action, empowering women as key change agents and engaging with local government has provided the solid foundation upon which to expand local development initiatives throughout the seven states of India in which THP is present.

CNP focuses on addressing the unique nutrition and feeding needs of children who are most at risk of malnutrition. This program uses a Training of Trainers (ToT) approach to empower sites to provide optimal care to children.  CNP’s training, tools, resources and support provides sites with targeted interventions to help address and prevent the causes of malnutrition, especially in children ages 0-5 and children with disabilities. CNP provides partnering sites individualized resources and tools to support behavioral and organizational change through a variety of methods consisting of training and hands on practicum. This program’s training covers a range of topics and health interventions including: nutrition basics, nutrition by age, hygiene and sanitation, growth tracking, health monitoring, nutrition interventions to address malnutrition and other common illnesses, feeding and positioning, food texture modification, and child development. CNP also provides sites with Holt’s online Nutrition Screening System Database. This database is an essential tool that enables sites to track and evaluate the health and growth of children and also address any health related issues early and effectively. Through CNP’s standardized training, long term supported implementation and rigorous evaluation, the program is able to implement a sustainable and scalable model. Local trained trainers are successfully able to scale the program to additional sites and provide ongoing support.Since the beginning of the program in 2013, the Child Nutrition Program has:•	Conducted more than 20,000 health and nutrition screenings, impacting more than 4,700 children while allowing for optimal health monitoring and intervention.

Combining all streams of data, formal and informal, will result in a broader analysis, inclusive of all stakeholders, and a baseline for future intervention, both in the phases of this project, and for the remaining centers to be addressed.WCDO will use existing collaborations with the DPC to reinforce and train CCPCs and CLPCs in the 100 most vulnerable sections, as well as training volunteer groups in preparedness and response, and engaging all of the community in evacuation planning. Concurrently, the project will develop designs for rehabilitating or improving 100 priority centers. These upgrades will include improving access routes and ensuring that centers are safe and gender-sensitive. The project will reinforce the sustainability of these strategic investments through training shelter managers and running simulations that include the community, reinforcing the trainings and encouraging further investment from the community and local government in both maintaining and improving evacuation centers and access routes.',NULL,NULL,'2019-10-01 00:00:00','2022-09-30 00:00:00','Disaster Prevention and Preparedness',NULL,NULL,'USD','01/10/2019',NULL,NULL,NULL,100,NULL,'communities',NULL,'specific_locations','Haiti','Susan Talbot','Senior Desk Officer','susant@worldconcern.org',NULL,'http://www.worldconcern.org','2019-10-15 00:00:00',NULL,'active',NULL,'FALSE'),
